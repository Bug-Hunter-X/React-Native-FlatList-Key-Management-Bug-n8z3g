In React Native, a subtle bug can occur when using the `FlatList` component with complex data structures or frequent updates.  If you're not careful about key management, React Native might not efficiently update the list, leading to performance issues or incorrect rendering.  For instance, if you use the index as a key (`keyExtractor={(item, index) => index}`), and your data changes, the component may not recognize the changes properly, resulting in stale data being displayed. This becomes extremely apparent when you insert or remove items from the list, causing the UI to be inconsistent or to render incorrectly.
